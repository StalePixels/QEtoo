This directory fakes the original libcuss with hacky tilemap versions


ORIGINAL README

This is an incredibly simple terminal abstraction library. You
specify which terminal you want by defining LIBCUSS_terminal and it,
hopefully, does the right thing. There's a build rule, libcussprogram,
which will build the supplied program once for each terminal defined
in the build.lua file.
